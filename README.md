This repo contains example models that use [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed).

# Note on Megatron examples

NOTE: We are in the process of deprecating the 3 Megatron-LM snapshots in this repo. Our current and future features with Megatron-LM will use the [Megatron-DeepSpeed fork](https://github.com/microsoft/Megatron-DeepSpeed). Currently the Megatron-DeepSpeed fork supports 3D parallelism + ZeRO Stage 1 and Curriculum Learning. Please see this new fork for further updates in the process.

Megatron-LM : This is a fairly old snapshot of Megatron-LM , and we have been using it show case the earlier features of DeepSpeed. This does not contain ZeRO-3 or 3D parallelism.

Megatron-LM-v1.1.5-3D_parallelism: This is a relatively new Megatron (Oct 2020), but before Megatron started supporting 3D parallelism. We ported this version to showcase how to use 3D parallelism inside DeepSpeed with Megatron.

Megatron-LM-v1.1.5-ZeRO3: The underlying Megatron version is same as the 3D_parallelism but it does not contain the 3D parallelism port. It however contains the most recent advances in DeepSpeed including ZeRO-3, ZeRO-3 Offload and ZeRO-Infinity. We did this separately from 3D parallelism port to isolate the changes required for each of them and to avoid users combining them together which is not supported, and will likely lead to more confusion.

Since the 3D parallelism is quite similar in both DeepSpeed and new Megatron, we don't have plans to update to new version immediately. But we do plan to update it in future as Megatron-LM adds more differentiating features.
